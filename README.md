**Discrete Stochastic Transmission Model for COVID-19**

This repository contains a Python implementation of a discrete stochastic transmission model for COVID-19, based on the methodology outlined in [Hellewell et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X20300747).

The model simulates the feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks through the isolation of contacts under various scenarios.
